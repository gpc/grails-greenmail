Greenmail Plugin for Grails 3
=============================

This is a fork of grails greenmail plugin for grails 3.

INSTALL
-------

Add a dependency for the plugin in `build.gradle`:

```

dependencies {    
    compile 'org.grails.plugins:greenmail:2.0.0.RC2'    
}

```


USAGE
-------

Provides a wrapper around [GreenMail](http://www.icegreen.com/greenmail/) and provides a view that displays `sent` messages - useful for testing application in the `development` or `test` environments.


### Installation

    grails install-plugin greenmail


The plugin assumes that you have some sort of Java mail provider installed (for instance the Grails mail plugin). You need to define a SMTP port for the mock Greenmail SMTP server to start with. Using the Grails Mail plugin, this is as simple as defining the `grails.mail.port` property in `Config.groovy`, like this (see the first line in the `development` and `test` blocks):

	environments {
	    production {
	        grails.serverURL = "http://www.changeme.com"
	    }
	    development {
		grails.mail.port = com.icegreen.greenmail.util.ServerSetupTest.SMTP.port
	        grails.serverURL = "http://localhost:8080/${appName}"
	    }
	    test {
		grails.mail.port = com.icegreen.greenmail.util.ServerSetupTest.SMTP.port
	        grails.serverURL = "http://localhost:8080/${appName}"
	    }
	}

You can also completely disable the plugin by using the config setting `grails.plugin.greenmail.disabled = true`.  For example, to disable greenmail in production:

	environments {
	    production {
	       grails.plugin.greenmail.disabled = true
	    }
	}

If you are experiencing timeouts when the application is starting greenmail you can increase this setting (in ms) from 
the config as follows: `grails.plugin.greenmail.serverStartupTimeout = 2000`

### Usage in Integration Tests

The plugin can be used to capture email messages during integration tests. For example:

	import com.icegreen.greenmail.util.*

	class GreenmailTests extends GroovyTestCase {
	    def mailService
	    def greenMail

	    void testSendMail() {
	        Map mail = [message:'hello world', from:'from@piragua.com', to:'to@piragua.com', subject:'subject']

	        mailService.sendMail {
	            to mail.to
	            from mail.from
	            subject mail.subject
	            body mail.message
	        }
	        
	        assertEquals(1, greenMail.getReceivedMessages().length)
		
	        def message = greenMail.getReceivedMessages()[0]
			
	        assertEquals(mail.message, GreenMailUtil.getBody(message))
	        assertEquals(mail.from, GreenMailUtil.getAddressList(message.from))
	        assertEquals(mail.subject, message.subject)
	    }

	    void tearDown() {
	        greenMail.deleteAllMessages()
	    }
	}


The plugin adds a `deleteAllMessages()` convenience method to the `greenMail` bean that deletes all received messages.

### Usage in running application 

The plugin provides a controller and view to show messages that are `sent` from the application.  Simply browse to http://localhost:8080/greenmail and it will show a list of messages sent.  You can click on the `show` link to view the raw message.


### Roadmap
This is a fully functional plugin, though there are some features that I think would be worth adding.  Contributions and patches are welcome!  

* Messages sent by the Grails Mail plugin have duplicate "TO:" fields in the raw message and in the address list, for instance if the recipient is spam@piragua.com, then that email address is listed twice when you retrieve the address list for RecipientType.TO (e.g. GreenMailUtil.getAddressList(message.getRecipients(javax.mail.Message.RecipientType.TO))
* Ability to view HTML email messages as they appear in a mail client rather than as RAW message.
